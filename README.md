I'm following the suckless convention of having a config.rs file and you'll have to recompile if you want anything different. Defaults are already pretty good. Anything worth dynamically changing is a flag. See example.

You might have to bring your own font. See config.rs.

TODO:

- Highlight range flag
- Multiple needles
- Needle head types
- Allow window resizing but keep aspect ratio
- Only redraw needle and redout
